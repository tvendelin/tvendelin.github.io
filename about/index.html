        <h2 id="about-this-website">About This Website</h2>
<p>The official public brain-dump of Toomas Vendelin would be the most accurate description.</p>
<p>This is a personal website, that is, it is an unsystematic collection of texts and pictures that
someone else might find useful and/or entertaining. It is not a blog, as I&rsquo;m not logging anything in
explicitly chronological order.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Linux system engineer and a certified Java developer in one package.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m well versed in automating the infrastructure setups combining syslinux
family, tfptp, DHCP, Kickstart, Autoyast, Preceed, Ansible and Puppet, also under strict security
requirements; PKI management and encryption; various identity and access management setups.</p>
<p>Before switching to a career in the IT industry entirely, I&rsquo;ve been a professional photographer and
a publisher for over 20 years. At some point the last century, I&rsquo;ve discovered that writing software
for my own purposes myself saves me enormous amounts of time, money, and nerve. So, from the end of
nineties up until 2010 I was living a second, secret life as a programmer and UNIX sysadmin in my own
company.</p>
<p>In 2011 I switched to IT career, and in 2012 I moved to Karlsruhe by invitation to work for 1&amp;1
Internet AG. Or, more precisely, for its daughter company 1&amp;1 De-Mail GmbH.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-Mail">De-Mail</a> is a German E-Government communications service.
Working in a paranoid security environment as a Linux system administrator was very instructive and
seasoning experience indeed.</p>
<p>Later on I switched over to Java in order to be able to communicate
with both system administrators and developers, who tend to speak in different languages even when
both speak German.</p>
<p>I am avid traveler and used to be an active couchsurfer until Couchsurfing was sold and has become a poor
man&rsquo;s Facebook. I speak English, German, Russian, Spanish, Estonian and some basic Portuguese and
Indonesian.</p>
<p>My recent hobby is to explore, what does it take to teach an unsuspecting non-geeky civilian to use
&lsquo;geeky stuff&rsquo; to their own benefit. That is, writing programs they need, or just making a better use
of their own computers. It&rsquo;s quite entertaining and quite different compared to sharing knowledge
with IT professionals.</p>
<p>I play chess when bored with everything else.</p>
