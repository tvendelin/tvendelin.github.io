        <h1 id="a-trip-to-spain-that-ended-up-in-senegal">A Trip to Spain That Ended up in Senegal</h1>
<p>Most reckless deeds start with a deceptively innocent plan.</p>
<p>Evan McGregor thought of going for a motorcycle ride in Spain, and ended up in Eastern Siberia and then
North America, the long way round. I  thought of going for a motorcycle ride in Spain, and ended up
in Dakar, and then Mbur in Senegal.</p>
<p>I moved to Karlsruhe in 2012 by invitation to work for 1&amp;1 Internet AG. Once I&rsquo;ve adopted to the new
center of my personal universe, I&rsquo;ve started to look at my new travel options. France was within a
bicycle ride now, Italy was just behind the Alps, and even Spain – a remote country I sincerely adore – wasn&rsquo;t
that remote anymore.</p>
<p>The transportation options were quickly narrowed down to flying (cheap, albeit inflexible) and
motorcycling (cheap, albeit perceptively suicidal). A quick googling brought me to the thriving
German second-hand vehicle market, and before I could say &lsquo;Jack Robinson&rsquo;, I drove a Kawasaki into
my instructor&rsquo;s testicles by mistaking the first gear for a foot peg.</p>
<p>So, the plan was to go for a ride in Spain. A quick googling or, rather, &lsquo;google-mapping&rsquo;, brought
my imagination to the straight of Gibraltar and then Morocco. The evil bug that eventually
transforms a weed smoker into a heroin addict, was at work at full throttle, and before I could say
&lsquo;Jack Robinson&rsquo;, I was reading up about the sand storm seasons in Mauritania, and baobab fruit
harvesting in Senegal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is insane, Toomas,&rsquo; — my mother said. &lsquo;Are you going to wear one of those silly leather
outfits with metal spikes, like these dentists and lawyers riding their noisy Harleys?&rsquo; No, of
course not, Mother, a motorcycle for me is just a cheap and flexible way to get from A to B, and my outfit
is purely protective and functional. I felt relieved, expecting an instructive talk about life and
death.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is insane, Toomas,&rsquo; — my boss, Christian Ciocina, said. &lsquo;5 weeks of vacation, continuously?
<em>Am Stück</em>? This is rare in Germany,&rsquo; — and he gave me a look.
&lsquo;Well, if the team agrees&hellip;&rsquo; Hey, fellows, any vacation plans for November? No, not this year.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is insane, Toomas,&rsquo; — I said to myself, exiting the 1&amp;1 building on July afternoon. &lsquo;You can
barely stand the heat, and it&rsquo;s only Germany. Again, are you heading to Sahara? Look into your
passport, if you are so senile that you&rsquo;ve forgot your own age!&rsquo; By the time I&rsquo;ve got home, I&rsquo;ve decided
to check my thermometer.  It showed +35° C. I&rsquo;ve opened a weather forcast web site to
examine the temperatures in North Africa. This time I could indeed say &lsquo;Jack Robinson&rsquo; quite a few
times before I found a spot in the middle of Lybian Desert that was hotter than Karlsruhe that day.</p>
<p>Nothing was preventing my upcoming act of insanity.</p>
