      <title>Ijen Volcano in East Java, Indonesia</title>

      <description>Ijen volcano in the Eastern edge of Java is, in my opinion, the most spectacular and accessible option around to visit a volcanic crater. It is also far less crowded than the Bromo national park, the closest similar site to compare.
Ijen is part of a volcanic complex, and is located in a caldera of the same name. The diameter of the caldera is about 20 km. This is all that remains of the &amp;lsquo;Old Ijen&amp;rsquo; volcano that was once well over 3000 meters tall, until the series of explosive eruptions destroyed it around 50 000 years ago.</description>

      <title>The Togutil of Halmahera – North Maluku, Indonesia</title>

      <description>The Togutil people live in Central and North-Eastern Halmahera Island, the largest in North Maluku, Indonesia. They still move around in jungle barefoot hunting wild boars, caring little about the &amp;lsquo;civilized&amp;rsquo; world around them. Some still wear just a loincloth, although T-shirts and other blessings of industrial production are becoming common. The Togutil live a semi-nomadic life: they have their small settlements, typically in a well-chosen place by a river, but if you decide to pay a surprise visit, be aware there could be nobody home for weeks in a row.</description>

      <description>Most reckless deeds start with a deceptively innocent plan.
Evan McGregor thought of going for a motorcycle ride in Spain, and ended up in Eastern Siberia and then North America, the long way round. I thought of going for a motorcycle ride in Spain, and ended up in Dakar, and then Mbur in Senegal.
I moved to Karlsruhe in 2012 by invitation to work for 1&amp;amp;1 Internet AG. Once I&amp;rsquo;ve adopted to the new center of my personal universe, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to look at my new travel options.</description>
