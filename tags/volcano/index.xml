      <description>Ijen volcano in the Eastern edge of Java is, in my opinion, the most spectacular and accessible option around to visit a volcanic crater. It is also far less crowded than the Bromo national park, the closest similar site to compare.
Ijen is part of a volcanic complex, and is located in a caldera of the same name. The diameter of the caldera is about 20 km. This is all that remains of the &amp;lsquo;Old Ijen&amp;rsquo; volcano that was once well over 3000 meters tall, until the series of explosive eruptions destroyed it around 50Â 000 years ago.</description>
