      <description>&amp;lsquo;What is Git?&amp;rsquo;, Yuni asks. Yuni is an online teacher of Indonesian and an aspiring Linux user.
&amp;lsquo;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s sort of a cross between a time machine and a kitchen blender, the one you make your smoothies with from all these exotic fruits that grow in your backyard&amp;rsquo;, Toomas responds. Toomas is a programmer and a Linux sysadmin.
&amp;lsquo;I know my kitchen blender A to Z&amp;rsquo;, says Yuni proudly. &amp;lsquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you tell me about time machine part first?</description>

      <title>Multilingual Blogging with Hugo - Introduction</title>
      <link>https://vendelin.org/geeky/hugo/introduction-multilngual-blogging-hugo/</link>

      <description>Hugo is a tool for building a multilingual static site. Combined with hosting on GitHub, your site will run on zero-budget, and without the hurdles of maintaining any web- or database servers. You will also enjoy the full control over your code.
Hugo allows you to separate writing content (you travel stories, cooking recipes, etc.) from designing your web site. You will need to design a bunch of HTML templates, write your stories, and Hugo will make the two a happy marriage with just a single four-letter word you type in a terminal.</description>

      <description>Hugo comes in a single binary file. Download the archive from releases page to your ~/Downloads directory. The version and checksums in the examples will likely be different, of course.
Calculate the checksum:
openssl sha256 -hex -r ~/Downloads/hugo_0.69.2_macOS-64bit.tar.gz f58e9312ee292c082c5833a128e751c1d07c5fb0da1b7584c09131f18e2ccf52 */Users/you/Downloads/hugo_0.69.2_macOS-64bit.tar.gz Verify that the checksum matches the one listed in hugo_0.69.2_checksums.txt file, that can be found on the same releases page. Extract the archive you&amp;rsquo;ve just verified:
tar zxvf ~/Downloads/hugo_0.69.2_macOS-64bit.tar.gz Copy the hugo executable to a directory in your $PATH.</description>

      <description>Install Hugo static site generator first.
Recursively clone the bootstrapping project:
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:tvendelin/errorist-bootstrap.git This pulls the Errorist theme as a git submodule and provides you with a skeleton project that needs only a few things to configure. Change into project directory and start the Hugo server:
cd errorist-bootstrap hugo server -D Open http://localhost:1313 in your browser. You should see a welcome message, and a link to the manuals. You will also notice that two languages – English and Russian – are already pre-configured.</description>

      <description>A Git / GitHub workflow for foreign language students and teachers was briefly discussed in a Skype conversation between Yuni, an online teacher of Indonesian, and Toomas, a Linux system engineer. They have agreed to go though it step by step, and so they did. Here, we are discussing things from the teacher&amp;rsquo;s perspective.
Grammar exercises as a Git repository published on GitHub Yuni creates a new folder on her computer, and initializes a Git repository inside it.</description>

      <description>Choose a name for your project. It&amp;rsquo;s just a name of a directory and has no other significance. I have chosen &amp;lsquo;multilingua&amp;rsquo; for a name.
In your terminal emulator, run
hugo new site multilingua This will create multilingua directory and produce the output:
Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in /Users/tom/learn/hugo/multilingua. Just a few more steps and you&amp;#39;re ready to go: 1. Download a theme into the same-named folder. Choose a theme from https://themes.</description>

      <description>This page will walk you through the steps necessary to add content to your website.
Though not a requirement, using tree command-line utility would be handy, if you get lost in directory structure. To install it, use the default package manager on Linux or MacPorts on Mac. tree shows the entire file hierarchy under specified directory – see the examples throughout this tutorial.

      <description>Grammar exercises published as a Git repository on GitHub can be forked by a student and completed on GitHub directly. Yuni, an online teacher of Indonesian, has created such a repository (see the previous chapter ). It contained just a single exercise. Now, after trying things out, she creates a repository with a set of exercises:
https://github.com/kartikayuni/Exercise-absolute-beginner
Maria, a Yuni&amp;rsquo;s student, got a link to that repository from her teacher, and is about to do her first homework on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Customizing Configuration for Multilingual Hugo-Managed Site</title>
      <link>https://vendelin.org/geeky/hugo/custom-multilingual-configuration-hugo/</link>

      <guid>https://vendelin.org/geeky/hugo/custom-multilingual-configuration-hugo/</guid>
      <description>A multilingual site managed with Hugo static generator requires a couple of extra steps. I essence, you just need to tell Hugo which languages are you going to use, and how these languages are called in these languages (Eesti keel for Estonian, Bahasa Indonesia for Indonesian, etc.). The rest is really optional.
Before we begin, though, I&amp;rsquo;d like to suggest a few
Configuration Adjustments I Choose YAML and config Directory Your project configuration sits by default in config.</description>

      <title>Hugo Theme Tutorial – Very Brief</title>
      <link>https://vendelin.org/geeky/hugo/creating-a-theme-for-hugo/</link>

      <guid>https://vendelin.org/geeky/hugo/creating-a-theme-for-hugo/</guid>
      <description>A &amp;lsquo;theme&amp;rsquo; in Hugo is a collection of HTML templates, stylesheets and other components that define what your site looks like, and are completely independent of your site content. That is, the very same theme can be used in many different websites. In software lingo this is known as the &amp;lsquo;separation of concerns&amp;rsquo; principle, which reminds of an old Swedish joke claiming that policemen always patrol in pairs because one can read and another can write.</description>

      <description>The example below shows how content of your pages should be written to have headers, paragraphs, etc. If you scroll down you will see what the resulting web page will look like.
Whatever you publish with Hugo and Errorist – the articles, blog posts, etc. – are written using a plain text editor. The special parts of you texts – headings, lists, links, images, blockquotes – are marked up with a simple notation called Markdown.</description>

      <description>We are finally ready to start adding content to our Hugo managed website. In your terminal, run:
hugo new poetry/lewis-carroll/the-walrus-and-the-carpenter/index.md Hugo will create the following directory structure under kontent:
kontent/ └── poetry └── lewis-carroll └── the-walrus-and-the-carpenter └── index.md Next, let&amp;rsquo;s open the kontent/poetry/lewis-carroll/the-walrus-and-the-carpenter/index.md. The section between the triple dashes is called &amp;lsquo;front matter&amp;rsquo; on planet Hugo. On my planet we might have called it &amp;lsquo;metadata&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;page parameters&amp;rsquo;. Whatever it&amp;rsquo;s called, it contains variables specific to your page in YAML format.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Content With Hugo</title>
      <link>https://vendelin.org/geeky/hugo/create-multilingual-content-hugo/</link>

      <guid>https://vendelin.org/geeky/hugo/create-multilingual-content-hugo/</guid>
      <description>Handling Multilingual Content is where Hugo really shines. However, since internationalization (i18n for short) is a pretty complex task, let&amp;rsquo;s throw together a brief list of
Requirements  The content translations should be added in an orderly manner. The content translations should be directly linkable to each other. Templates should not contain any hard-coded language-specific text. Instead, translations for such text should be defined separately and loaded according to the language of the content.</description>

      <title>YAML – the Very Basics</title>

      <description>This is grossly simplified introduction to YAML . The complete official documentation is available here . However, you will only need a small subset of it to configure your Hugo project and the &amp;lsquo;front matter&amp;rsquo; of your Markdown files. This little tutorial provides a starting point.
YAML is a format for representing data structure in a human-readable way. YAML&amp;rsquo;s block collections use indentation for scope and begin each entry on its own line.</description>

      <title>Including Images in Multilingual Pages with Hugo</title>
      <link>https://vendelin.org/geeky/hugo/images-multilingual-pages-hugo/</link>

      <guid>https://vendelin.org/geeky/hugo/images-multilingual-pages-hugo/</guid>
      <description>Including images in multilingual context is a tricky business. The problem is, an image is a piece of content in its own right, with its own attributes, most important being the caption, which for N languages translates into N captions. In a typical editorial workflow, photos and articles come from two different types of sources (photographers and writers, respectively), and it is a photographer, who writes the captions – in one language at least.</description>

      <description>Promoting certain articles on the front page of your Hugo managed site will be the next step after creating some content. You will need a summary for each such page, and a text that will appear in links – a link title.
Page Title and Link Title Yes, a page can have more than one title. There are linkTitle and title front matter parameters, and there are corresponding {{.LinkTitle}} and {{.</description>

      <title>Customize Web Page Layout: Hugo Content Types</title>
      <link>https://vendelin.org/geeky/hugo/layout-customize-hugo/</link>

      <description>Style consistency is important, and one of the benefits of generating pages with Hugo (as opposed to editing HTML code for each page directly) is a very little amount of HTML code to handle. So far, all the HTML we used were just four (!) template files plus a partial for the breadcrumbs and an image markdown hook. However, some types of content inevitably won&amp;rsquo;t fit the Procrustean bed of a simplistic theme.</description>

      <title>Internal and External Links with Hugo</title>

      <guid>https://vendelin.org/geeky/hugo/cross-reference-external-links-hugo/</guid>
      <description>The Markdown syntax for creating a link is straightforward, but you likely need to make sure that you are not creating any dead links at least internally to your site. You might also want to customize how different links behave. For instance, you may want the external links to open in a new tab, so that you site visitor stays at your site.
Internal Links Referencing pages of the same site is done with two shortcodes, ref and relref.</description>

      <description>So, you are happy with the preview provided by the local Hugo server, and you want to publish your site. Make sure git status doesn&amp;rsquo;t show anything uncommitted changes (you do keep versions of your project under control, don&amp;rsquo;t you?). Then, manually or with some shell magic, change the draft front matter parameter to false for the pages you plan to publish. Restart your Hugo server without the -D option and check that nothing is missing.</description>
